# InterSCity Experiment - Emulation Based On Anomaly Detection In Car Traffic

This repository contains our analysis and everything needed to run the
experiment **Emulation Based on Anomaly Detection In Car Traffic**. In this
experiment we evaluate actuation in a city traffic simulation via traffic boards,
that alerts drivers about closed streets and are triggered via anomaly detection.
In our context, we refer to **events** as **close street events**, that are
configurable and predefined by us.

So, in this experiment, we:

- Simulate a city traffic

- During the simulation, a few events will affect the roads, closing them

- Since the roads behaviour are going to change, we will detect them as
anomalies and trigger traffic boards

- Drivers that arrive at nodes containing triggered traffic boards will
have a chance to recalculate their route, letting them plan a better route

We separated the experiment in two scenarios: in the first, that we called
**validation scenario**, we used a fairly simple graph to validate our models and
algorithms. In the second scenario, that we called **sao paulo scenario**, we
used a reduced SÃ£o Paulo map, with events in two clusters, and with traffic boards
in high traffic edges. For each scenario we used a three phases separation, and in
each phase we runned 20 simulations. The first phase is a simulation **without
events** and **without traffic boards**, and was used as our baseline to find
the thresholds to classify roads as anomalies. The second phase is a simulation
**with events and without traffic boards**, and was expected to have the slowest
travels in comparison to the others two phases. Finally, the third phase is a
simulation **with events and with traffic boards**, were we used a small anomaly
detection system (written in Apache Spark) to trigger the traffic boards.

Next, we describe the structure of this repository, which will help
you to understand and reproduce the results.

#### `img` folder

This folder holds the images used in our Jupyter Notebooks. You can skip it! :)

#### `running` folder

This folder holds everything needed to reproduce the simulation and the scenarios.
There you will find a `README.md` file that better describes the steps needed
to rerun the scenarios.

#### `scenario_1_validation` folder

This folder holds the results of the first scenario simulated. In the
`scenario_1_validation/datasets` folder you will find three folders, one for each
phase of the scenario, and in each of these folders, an `output.csv` file, which
aggregates the results of the 20 rounds simulated. Also, in each of these
datasets folder there is a `rounds` folder, that
stores the results of each round. In `scenario_1_validation/inputs` you
will find the inputs used by the simulator for this scenario.

#### `scenario_2_sao_paulo` folder

This folder holds the results of the second scenario simulated. In the
`scenario_2_sao_paulo/datasets` folder you will find three folders, one for each
phase of the scenario, and in each of these folders, an `output.csv` file, which
aggregates the results of the 20 rounds simulated. Also, in each of these
datasetss folder there is a `rounds` folder, that
stores the results of each round. In `scenario_2_sao_paulo/inputs` you
will find the inputs used by the simulator for this scenario.

#### `utils` folder

This folder holds useful scripts and Jupyter Notebook that you might find useful
if you want to reproduce everything that we used. For instance, here you can find
a Jupyter Notebook that generates the `map.xml` file used by the simulator in the
second scenario of the experiment.

## Experiment Analysis

Our complete data analysis can be found in the `Analysis.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook
file. You can open
the file using Github itself to see our results and analysis or, to reproduce the
results, you can open it with Jupyter Notebook and rerun the cells (we recommend
reading this whole file before trying to run it). Also, if you have any questions,
you can contact us in IRC (freenode#ccsl-usp).
