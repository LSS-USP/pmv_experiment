# Generating the rounds (running simulations)

To generate the rounds (and run complete simulations scenarios) you should
  run our anomaly detection and then the simulation. To run the anomaly
  detection check the README.md at `anomaly_detection` folder, to run the 
  simulation check the README.md at `simulation` folder.
